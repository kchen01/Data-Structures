My partner and I looked at the dataset and noticed that the countries with the highest population tended to have the most Emissions. This was unsurprising because more people and activity tend to produce more waste, so it did make sense. Percent Population Growth was usually the same as Urban Population growth, and I assumed those would both be higher in larger countries. This was not true, most of the smaller countries had larger percent population growth than the larger ones, which makes sense now that we both think about it(Smaller Population means every birth affects the percent population growth more). This was pretty interesting to see different stats about all of the countries in the world
